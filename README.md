Fluxplant is a cloud based home water monitoring system that allows users to track their water consumption. My projects consists of three main portions. An Arduino module for tracking water consumption in a pipe, a chrome app for receiving the Arduino data over Bluetooth, and a web application complete with a server for storing user data and User Interface for viewing useful consumption statistics.
