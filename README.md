# FluxPlant: A BSE Project #

Fluxplant is a cloud based home water monitoring system that allows users to track their water consumption. My projects consists of three main portions. An Arduino module for tracking water consumption in a pipe, a chrome app for receiving the Arduino data over Bluetooth, and a web application complete with a server for storing user data and User Interface for viewing useful consumption statistics.

### File Structure ###

* Arduino Code - Folder containing all files used in developement for the Arduino module in the projects.
* Chrome App - Desktop toolkit developed for recieving data from Arduino module and dumping to Server in cloud.
* Flux_Plan_PyWeb - Server and Web Application that stores user data, recieves sensor data, and displays consumption statistics for users.
